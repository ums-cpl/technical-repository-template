# misc-technical-repository-template
A minimal template for technical work organized as tasks. Includes a runner script (run_tasks.sh), container definitions (Apptainer), workload manager integration (e.g. SLURM), and example tasks and experiments. Use this as a starting point for benchmarks, evaluations, and other reproducible experiment workflows.
